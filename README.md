I build end-to-end: orchestration systems for GTM teams, AI products for end-users, and compliance infrastructure underneath both.

**Technical range:**
- **GTM Ops:** Vendor intelligence, CRM orchestration, data enrichment (60M rows processed)
- **AI Products:** 9 production apps with voice-protective UX and adaptive learning
- **Platform:** 100+ tool orchestration, 20 MCP servers, FERPA-compliant audit systems
- **Quality:** 62 agents evaluated on 10-dimension rubric, adversarial testing

→ [Systems & Architecture](./SYSTEMS.md) — If you hire for infrastructure, platform, or distributed systems

→ [Evaluation & Testing](./EVALS.md) — If you hire for QA, ML ops, or testing infrastructure
