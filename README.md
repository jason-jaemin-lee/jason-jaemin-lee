## 📝 About This Profile

This GitHub profile is organized by hiring lens, not chronology. Each page showcases the same body of work from a different role perspective:

- **Recruiters in sales/partnerships** → Start with GTM
- **Product managers** → Start with Product
- **Infrastructure engineers** → Start with Systems
- **ML ops/QA leads** → Start with Evals
- **Compliance officers** → Start with Governance

All 5 pages connect to the same underlying systems architecture, but emphasize different value propositions.
